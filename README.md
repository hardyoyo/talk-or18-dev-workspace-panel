# OR2018 - GT21 - Developing like you live in the Future
## Developer Workspaces Panel

An introduction to the Developer Workspaces Panel at [Open Repositories 2018](http://www.or2018.net/), June 4-7, 2018 in Bozeman, Montana.

Abstract: This will be an introduction to the panel topics, as well as an introduction to [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) as a tool for creating and managing a developer workspace.

Abstract for panel: Some of us still develop the traditional way, and install the entire application stack on our own computers. But there are many other options available: Vagrant, Docker, or IDEs in the cloud. All approaches share the same aim: to minimize the effort required in standing up a new developer workspace, and to ensure this setup is shareable and repeatable. This panel will consist of live demos of all of these options, with plenty of opportunities to discuss best practices.
