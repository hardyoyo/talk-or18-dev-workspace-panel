---
# Predictable, Repeatable, Sharable
* Vagrant
* Docker
* wrappers for Docker (Codenvy, Docksal, Lando etc.)

---
# Vagrant Up
https://www.vagrantup.com/
"Development Environments Made Easy"
* How to install: download the thing, click on the thing, do what you're told.
* Yes, even you Linux users.

---
# Vagrant is a tool for managing a VMhttps://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1963
* "Providers": VirtualBox, VMWare, AWS, and more
* "Provisioners": Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and more
* "Plugins": Hostname/DNS, Caching, Notifications
* Tunneling via *ngrok* to your workspace for quick demos

---
# Vagrant is Slow
* Virtual Machines eat up a ton of RAM and CPU
* Watching a machine provision itself is interesting the first few times
* Recommendation: find something to do with your hands

---
# Vagrant is a way to communicate
* Show ops how all the pieces work
* Show off your work in progress to your boss or "customer"
* Bounce ideas off other developers
* Impromptu pair programming at at distance

---
# Why I keep coming back to Vagrant: communication
* Let's pretend you all are my "customer"
* It's demo time!
* And code! On screen! Awesome!
